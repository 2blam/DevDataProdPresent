## Background
In this project, by using Shiny, we adopted motor trend car toad tests (mtcars) dataset to create a model for predicting Miles Per Gallon (MPG) usage of a car.

The dataset with 32 observations on 11 variables.
```{r}
library(datasets)
head(mtcars)
dim(mtcars)
```

## Design of the Shiny Application - Frontend

- We created a web form to let the user input three pieces of information: (i) Weight in Pound, (ii) Number of Cylinder, and (iii)Type of Transmission.
- Once the user pressed the submit button, the data will send to backend.

## Design of the Shiny Application - Backend

- In backend, we loaded the dataset, converted the categorical variables into factors and prepared the linear model.
- The linear model is shown as follows:

$$mpg \sim wt + cyl + am$$

where $mpg$ is miles per gallon, $wt$ is weight in 1000 lb, $cyl$ is number of cylinder and $am$ is the type of transmission (0 - Automatic, 1 - Manual)
